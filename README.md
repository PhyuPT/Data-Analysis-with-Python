# Data-Analysis-with-Python
The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, USA. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015
Use the function boxplot to visualize price outliers for houses with and without a waterfront view
Use the function regplot to show whether the correlation between sqft_above and price is positive or negative
Fit a linear regression model to predict the price using the feature 'sqft_living', then calculate the R^2. 
Fit a linear regression model to predict the 'price' using the list of features.
Create a pipeline object that scales the data, performs a polynomial transform, and fits a linear regression model
Create and fit a Ridge regression object using the training data, setting the regularization parameter to 0.1, and calculate the R^2 using the test data
Perform a second-order polynomial transform on both the training data and testing data. Create and fit a Ridge regression object using the training data, setting the regularization parameter to 0.1
